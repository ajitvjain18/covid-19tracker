# covid-19tracker
With the massive outbreaks and news spreading faster than the CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) itself, be aware of the actual stats that are affecting the country we live in.

I created a python project by which one can get the covid stats like total recoveries, total deceased, total positive cases, etc.
In this program, we can also track covid-19 stats country-wise.

MODULE: pip install covid
